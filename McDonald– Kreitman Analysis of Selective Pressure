McDonaldâ€“ Kreitman Analysis of Selective Pressure

1. Full length LTTR nucleotide sequences of the most variable LTTRS in P. aeruginosa were obtained from the JGI IMG database and concatenated on the terminal.

Extract the ID numbers from the AA sequences which made a list of IDs using the following code:
biolinux@biolinux-VirtualBox[MKT] perl -ne 'if(/^>(\S+)/){print "$1\n"}' 112 > 112_ids 


Then extract the DNA sequences with the ID numbers from the fasta file containing all DNA sequences 
biolinux@biolinux-VirtualBox[MKT] perl -ne 'if(/^>(\S+)/){$c=$i{$1}}$c?print:chomp;$i{$_}=1 if @ARGV' 0_ids all_dna_sequences > 0_reps


2. Outliers P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas sp. AK6U & two housekeeping genes (rpoD, gyrB) were also selected as controls for this analysis. Sequences were obtained using the Pseudomonas database and BLASTn.
