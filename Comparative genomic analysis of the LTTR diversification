2. Variance of each of the individual LTTRs was calculated by dividing the number of “clusters” of identical sequences (Vn) by the total number of homologues in the sequenced strains (Sn).

3. Core top 10 least and most variable LTTRs were identified with results tabulated and formatted using the tidyverse package v1.3.0 and pie-charts were created using ggplot2 in Rstudio.
